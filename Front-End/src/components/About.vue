    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm a college student who is passionate about programming.</li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>I'm currently studying Web Development at ESMAD in Portugal.</li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        I have a strong interest in web development, and I'm currently
        learning Vue and React. I do have some experience with Node.js and
        Express for backend development, and I'm also familiar with MongoDB
        and MySQL for database management.
      </li>
      <br /><br />
      <li>
        Even though I'm still a student, I'm always looking for new
        opportunities to learn and grow as a developer. I'm also interested
        in working on open source projects, so if you have any ideas, feel
        free to <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.
      </li>

      <br /><br />
      <li>
        I don't have much experience when it comes to UI/UX design, but I
        do try to make my best effort to make my projects look as good as
        possible, so go easy on me on that regard ðŸ˜Š
      </li>
      <br /><br />

      <li>
        In my free time, I like to play video games, watch movies and TV
        shows and learn new Frameworks and Libraries. I also enjoy
        listening to music. I'm also a big fan the band PowerWolf.
